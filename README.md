This repository contains a solution to find the second maximum element in a given list of numbers. This can be useful in cases where determining both the highest value and the next highest value from a dataset is required.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Ensure that you have the following software installed:

.NET SDK
Running the Solution
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/BelalMuhamed/GetSecondMaxSolution.git
cd GetSecondMaxSolution
Open the solution in your preferred C# IDE (such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code) or run it via the terminal.

Run the program to see the output for a sample list of numbers.

Example Usage
Here's an example of how the solution can be used:

csharp
Copy code
int[] numbers = { 10, 20, 30, 40, 50 };
int secondMax = GetSecondMax(numbers);
Console.WriteLine("The second maximum value is: " + secondMax);
How It Works
The solution iterates over the list of numbers to find the maximum and second maximum values.
The function returns the second maximum value, or an error if fewer than two unique numbers are provided.
